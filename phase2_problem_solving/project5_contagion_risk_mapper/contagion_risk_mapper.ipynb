    "- Jonas contacted Nina (as early as 2025-03-20)Emma (2025-03-21 & 22)\n",
    "- Jonas was contacted by Alice Carter on 2025-03-24\n",
    "- Jonas has not reported any symptoms to date\n",

    "- Alice was in contact with Ben, Jonas, Leo, and Nina between 2025-03-20 and 2025-03-26\n",

    "- He had earlier contact with both Nina and Emma than any other crew member.\n",
    "- His interactions fall within plausible incubation windows.\n",
    "- He has not shown symptoms, suggesting possible asymptomatic transmission.\n",

    "Alice Carter appears frequently in contact chains and was in touch with both symptomatic crew on the same day (2025-03-24), the only shared exposure date. This positions her as a possible intermediary.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a definitive transmission source cannot be confirmed without clinical testing, the contact patterns suggest that both Jonas and Alice played key roles in the potential spread. They should be treated as **epidemiologically significant contacts** and monitored accordingly.\n"
