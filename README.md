# Python Tools for Space Medicine & Life Support Systems

This repository is dedicated to applying Python for solving real-world problems in **space medicine**, **life support systems**, and **human factors** during space missions.

As a medical microbiologist and ongoing Planetary Sciences MSc student, I’m combining my clinical and environmental health background with Python to explore data-driven solutions that improve astronaut health and operational safety.



## Project Objectives

- Phase 1: Python fundamentals refresher - revisited core Python concepts through space health-themed exercises. Topics included variables, data types, lists, dictionaries, conditionals, loops, functions, and file handling. The goal was to rebuild confidence with basic Python syntax and logic in preparation for more advanced work.
- Phase 2:  Problem solving with Python - focused on breaking down real-world problems in space medicine and life support systems into structured, code-based solutions. Emphasis on logic, data workflows, and practical thinking.
- Phase 3: Modeling and simulation - developing small-scale models and simulations to explore challenges like oxygen use, CO₂ buildup, and crew health monitoring. These projects aim to bridge data with real mission scenarios and will later support more interactive or automated tools.


## Next Steps

- Incorporate radiative/biomedical modeling (e.g., space radiation, bone loss)
- Transition toward interactive dashboards or automation-ready tools
