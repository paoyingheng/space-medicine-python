# Space-Medicine-Python

This repository is dedicated to applying Python for solving real-world problems in **space medicine**, **life support systems**, and **human factors** during space missions.

As a medical microbiologist and Planetary Sciences MSc student, I’m combining my clinical and environmental health background with Python to explore data-driven solutions that improve astronaut health and operational safety.

## Project Objectives

- Phase 1: Master Python fundamentals through meaningful, applied projects
- Phase 2: Develop the ability to break down space-health-related problems into data analysis workflows
- Phase 3: Build a portfolio of realistic, risk-focused simulations relevant to long-duration spaceflight and planetary exploration

## Next Steps

- Incorporate radiative/biomedical modeling (e.g., space radiation, bone loss)
- Transition toward interactive dashboards or automation-ready tools
